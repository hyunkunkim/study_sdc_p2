# Writeup: 3D-Objects (project 2)

This repository is for the Udacity Self Driving Car (SDC) nanodegree project 2 and 3.  
In project 2 we find 3D bounding boxes from a single point cloud data. In project 3, we further develop to go beyond detecting objects and to tracking 3D objects in time.  
This writeup shows how I followed the instructions for the SDC course and implemented the first part, 3D object detection.  
** Please do not copy my project just to pass SDC. It is considered cheating and will violate Udacity's code of honor. If you like the materials in this repository consider taking SDC nanodegree. **
